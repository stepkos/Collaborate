## How it works

This is appliaction called Collaborate. Its primary concept was to be a platform to find collaborators to help with your programming projects. Imagine a scenario where you are high school student and you are developing fantastic, big side project just for fun or hobby. It could be nice, if your classmates were into programming and wanted to help you, but what if they are not? There comes with help our Collaborate! You can post your project description on it and technologies used in it. The offert is then visible to other users on platform. They can read it and like it. You can too, choose from among people who liked your project the most suitable for collaboration, start chatting and working on code. Its a bit of mix between sites like LinkedIn.com and Tinder, because here we have similiar "match" system

## Design patter
* What is interesting about project its design pattern we decided to implement - **Model View Controller**
* We modified .htaccess file to send all requests to index.php from which different routes are defined. Everything on pure php without framework!

* **Models** handle fetching and sending data to database
* **Views** display html sites with fetched data
* **Controllers** provide additional logic for views and models if needed


## Comments and adnotations

* "match" system on backend isn't handled due to teacher's deadline
* For chats, they have also developed visuals but are not handled in any way

## Used technologies
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript ES6
* Jquery.js
* Hammer.js
* PHP
* MySQL
